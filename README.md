# Sales Analysis Project Using Python 

## Overview of Project 
The Sales Analysis project involves analyzing hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. The goal is to gain insights into the sales data to make informed business decisions.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Drop NaN values from the DataFrame.
   - Remove rows based on specific conditions.
   - Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype) for better analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Identify the best month for sales and calculate the total earnings for that month.
   - Determine the city that sold the most products.
   - Analyze the best time to display advertisements for maximum customer engagement.
   - Find products that are most often sold together.
   - Identify the product that sold the most and analyze the reasons behind its success.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use matplotlib to create visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to represent the data.
   - Label the graphs appropriately for clarity and understanding.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
   - Provide recommendations for business strategies based on the analysis.
